# Skin-Cancer-Malignant-vs.-Benign
## Skin Cancer Detection using EfficientNetB5 and CNN
***
### ABSTRACT:
***
Now a days many people are suffering from
many disease and many type of cancer. Skin
cancer became a common disease, which is
very difficult to find and making delay will lead
to severe problems. Even it takes lots of time
and too expensive for curing the disease. Skin
cancer occurs because of abnormal growth of
skin cells. These might also take’s places
because of Ultra Violet radiation. There are
many types of skin cancer, but most rapid and
frequent skin cancers are malignant and
benign disease. Early detection helps for faster
recovery. CNN helps in finding Cancer of
patient more accurately by Image
Classification. The CNN helps to find skin
cancers and various disease with best results.
In these research paper, we will use CNN
model for Classification and prediction of
Malignant and benign disease.

### INTRODUCTION :
***
According to World health
organization(WHO) skin cancer is one-third of
all types of cancers which are diagnosed in the
world. Over past few years the rate of people
effected due to skin cancer is constantly
increasing globally. From many of skin cancers
Malignant and bengian are more harmfull and
leads to dead quickly. Finding them quickly
can save lives. These camcers will spread and
expand throught all body parts. Skin cancer is
primarily caused by the skins sensitivity to
ultraviolet rays from the sun and the
unrepaired DNA in the skin cells causes lesions
on skin, which can generate genetic defects on
skin and can easily spread to other body parts.
The patient with skin cancer is completely
unaware of recognizing the growth of skin
cancer at its initial stage. Skin cancer when
identified in early stages can be easily cured.
Due to increase in skin cancer cases the
mortality rate is increased and the medical
treatment required to cure it is very
expensive. There are various types of skin
cancers in which melanoma the last and
hazardous skin cancer which has the highest
mortality rate it starts through few different
ways.

From figure we can clearly understand that
These cancer will increase mostly between age
from 20 to 24. Males around 50 to 60 are
mostly effecting and male with age of 85 to 90
are least effected. Female from 90 and above
are effecting a lot . From diagram , We can see
that females are mostly effecting from cancer
than male. But at older stage females have
significantly lower rate.

### MATERIALS AND TOOLS:
***
We are using Python language for
programming as it has very large libraries like
NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib which will helps in
showing statistical analysis and plot visual
graphs. The platform that we used is Google
Colab for working IDE systems. In these
research paper, a core i5 laptop is used as
workstation.

### DATA SET USED:
***
In this research, a dataset from Kaggle is used,
which is named SKIN CANCER: MALIGNANT
VS BENIGN. The dataset contains of 3297
images . The dataset is divided into two
sections : train(2647 images), which is used
for training the model. And used 660 images
which is used for testing the accuracy of
training data. All images were resized to 224 ×
224. And the images are high quality with RGB.

### METHODS: 
***
There are many techniques to use for this type
of model but we used CNN in deep learning
which in is best in output and accuracy. We
have several other options such as Artificial
Neural Networks(ANN), Generative
Adversarial Networks(GAN), Reccurent
Neural Neteorks(RNN) but for image
classification CNN is best used. They
significantly enhances the capabilities of the
feed forward network such as MLP by
inserting convolution layers. They are
particularly suitable for spatial data, object
recognition and image analysis using
multidimensional neurons structures
